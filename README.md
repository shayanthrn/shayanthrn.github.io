# Web simulation of UbuntuOS

This is my personal portfolio website of theme Ubuntu 20.04, made using Next.js & tailwind CSS.
The source code belongs to https://github.com/vivek9patel/vivek9patel.github.io, but I made some customizations and personalizations to meet my requirments.

To run this on localhost
type `npm start` and when u are done coding type `npm run build` to build your app.

_NOTE: if you have yarn just replace `npm start` and `npm run build` with `yarn start` and `yarn build`._
